Mobile Pastoralists struggle with many hardships, but one that is making their way of life increasingly less sustainable, is a lack of access to education. If pastoralists want to educate their children, they often have to send them to far-off schools, where children can gain valuable knowledge, but at the cost not learning the traditions of their culture or the skills they need to survive as pastoralists when they get older. This contributes to young people abandoning pastoralism in favor of a more-modern life. With mobile education, children can gain the literacy and numeracy that will help them prosper later in life while remaining connected with their families. A mobile application, in particular, can have a powerful impact on mobile pastoralists’ education, combining mobility with multimedia and interactivity. Pocklit uses audio, text, images, and voice input to teach people basic literacy and math. Navigation is simple and based largely on pictures and voice commands, making it easy to use, even for those who are not familiar with mobile phones. Striving for universality, Pocklit’s educational modules are not fixed, but rather are uploaded by NGOs or government agencies to best serve pastoralist communities in a given region. With different groups working together, we can use the power of education to maintain the ties that bind pastoralist communities together and give their children the opportunity to prosper, without having to leave their families behind.
